Advantages of Seaborn
Seaborn is a powerful visualization library in Python that builds on Matplotlib and provides several advantages:

Built-in Themes: Seaborn comes with several built-in themes and color palettes that make it easy to create aesthetically pleasing visualizations. This helps in making your plots more attractive and interpretable without much effort.

Statistical Plots: Seaborn simplifies the creation of complex statistical plots like violin plots, boxen plots, and pair plots, which can be more cumbersome to create with just Matplotlib.

Automatic Aesthetics: Seaborn automatically manages the aesthetics of the plots, including axes and labels, allowing for more focus on the data rather than tweaking the visual aspects.

Higher-level Abstractions: Seaborn provides higher-level functions for plotting data relationships, which makes it easier to visualize complex datasets.

Enhanced Data Handling: Seaborn integrates closely with Pandas DataFrames, allowing you to plot directly from DataFrames and handle data more intuitively.
